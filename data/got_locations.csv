Built in the shadow of Ghiscari traditions, Astapor stood proud yet rotted from within, its rulers—known as the Good Masters—glutted on cruelty and wealth. When Daenerys Stormborn arrived, dragon at her side and fire in her heart, the city was cast into chaos. The chains were shattered, the masters burned, and the Unsullied marched free. Yet liberty bore a steep price, and Astapor soon spiraled into anarchy, consumed by the very rage it once subdued.

Here, snowdrifts swallow the sky, and great white forests hold whispers of a forgotten age. Giants roam the icy valleys, mammoths thunder across the tundra, and the Free Folk—called Wildlings by those in the South—make homes from bone, stone, and fire. Yet colder terrors linger. In the deep dark, the White Walkers stir—creatures of ice and night, born before the histories of men. The Wall was built to guard against such nightmares, but even it could not stand forever.

Since then, the Lannisters have ruled with coin and cunning, commanding Westeros with both blade and banknote.

The Reach,LOC049,1009,2041.9,"The Reach blooms like a garden beneath golden sun, a land of rolling hills, rich harvests, and ancient halls. It is the heart of chivalry in Westeros, where knights ride beneath banners of flowers and song lingers in every breeze. Ruled from Highgarden by House Tyrell, its wealth flows in grain and beauty, feeding both kings and wars. Yet beneath its splendor lies ambition, sharp as any sword. For in the Reach, roses bear thorns, and the sweetest fruit often hides the fiercest seed.",https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MrAnderson-Data/got-tableau-dashboard/main/images/location/The_Reach.png
The Shadow Lands,LOC050,6023,662,"The Shadow Lands rise twisted and terrible beyond Asshai, a realm where the earth itself seems cursed. Mountains black as obsidian claw at a sky forever shrouded in ash, and no birds sing in their skies. Strange beasts prowl the gloom, and glowing stones light paths few dare to tread. It is said dragons were born here, where magic pulses strong and wild, and shadows have minds of their own. The brave who enter seldom return—those who do, return changed. For in the Shadow Lands, even light must obey the dark.",https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MrAnderson-Data/got-tableau-dashboard/main/images/location/The_Shadowlands.png
The Shadow Sea,LOC051,6311,581.1,"The Shadow Sea lies cold and black beyond the eastern edge of the known world, where maps fade and legends take hold. Its waters are still, yet heavy with dread, said to reflect no stars and swallow sound. Few dare sail its depths, for ships vanish like whispers, and monsters are said to stir beneath its glassy surface. East of Asshai, where shadow and sea meet, the world unravels into myth. In the Shadow Sea, the edge of the earth is not a fall—but a drowning.",https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MrAnderson-Data/got-tableau-dashboard/main/images/location/The_Shadow_Sea.png

Forged in fury, this is a land shaped by storms and ruled by those who do not break. From the ancient halls of Storm’s End, House Baratheon held sway—lords as tempestuous as the land itself. Rain lashes its coasts, and wind howls through its forests, but its people endure, bold and unbending. Here, every storm is a test, and only the strong are left standing when the skies clear.",https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MrAnderson-Data/got-tableau-dashboard/main/images/location/The_Sormlands.png
The Trident,LOC053,1196,2395.7,"The Trident winds through the heart of Westeros, a mighty river where kingdoms have risen and fallen in its muddy waters. Its three great forks—Red, Blue, and Green—converge in a current that carries both life and legacy. Here, Rhaegar Targaryen fell beneath Robert’s warhammer, and the crown slipped from dragon to stag. The Trident feeds fields and cities, but it also drinks blood, for every ripple remembers rebellion. In its flow, the realm’s fate is forever written, and often rewritten in war.",https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MrAnderson-Data/got-tableau-dashboard/main/images/location/The_Trident.png
The Twins,LOC054,1065,2587.7,"Straddling the Green Fork of the Trident, the Twins are the ancestral seat of House Frey, a house known more for ambition than honor.

The Knights of the Vale are among the finest horsemen in Westeros, and their late entry into the wars of the realm often turns tides.",https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MrAnderson-Data/got-tableau-dashboard/main/images/location/The_Vale.png
The Wall,LOC056,1331.3,3604,"A colossal monument of ice and magic, the Wall stands as the last defense between the realms of men and the wild terrors of the far north. Raised eight thousand years ago by Brandon the Builder, it stretches 700 feet high and 300 miles long.

Not Available,LOC060,3000,1500,"The lands deemed ""Not Available"" are the shadowed edges of maps and the whispers in campfire tales. They represent the forgotten, the unexplored, and the erased.
