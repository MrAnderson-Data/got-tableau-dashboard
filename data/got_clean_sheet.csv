Brandon Stark, once a boy who dreamed of knights, became a vessel for ancient power.
He walked through wolves, flew through ravens, and witnessed the birth of legends.
As the Three-Eyed Raven, he saw past, present, and future—not as memories, but as truths.
Detached from grief, above fear, he watched as the world turned. And when the ashes cooled, it was Bran who became king—not to rule, but to remember.
For in memory lies the fate of men.","Eddard Stark, Catelyn Stark","Robb Stark, Sansa Stark, Arya Stark, Rickon Stark​",None

Sharp-tongued and observant, Myranda played the game of nobles from the periphery, always watching — never forgetting.",Yohn Royce,Not Available,None
CH291,Sansa Stark,https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MrAnderson-Data/got-tableau-dashboard/main/images/characters/Sansa_Stark.png,Human,House Stark,https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MrAnderson-Data/got-tableau-dashboard/main/images/house/House_Stark.png,Alive,"Sansa Stark, the red-haired wolf of Winterfell, was born into nobility but cast early into a cruel game of thrones. Sent south with dreams of courtly romance, she became a political hostage of the Lannisters, a pawn in the war that would shatter the Seven Kingdoms. Under Queen Cersei’s withering eye and Joffrey’s sadistic cruelty, her innocence was burned away.
She bore the burden of silence, surviving with poise where others fell in fury. Her time in King’s Landing, the Vale, and Winterfell shaped her into a keen political mind, refined by Littlefinger’s manipulation and tempered by the horror of Ramsay Bolton’s cruelty.
At war's end, she declared the North an independent realm once more, crowned as Queen in the North—a monarch forged not of steel and fire, but of ice and wisdom.","Ned Stark, Catelyn Stark","Arya Stark, Robb Stark, Jon Snow, Bran Stark, Rickon Stark",None
CH292,Nymeria,https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MrAnderson-Data/got-tableau-dashboard/main/images/characters/NotAvailable.png,Direwolf,House Stark,https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MrAnderson-Data/got-tableau-dashboard/main/images/house/House_Stark.png,Alive,"Named for the warrior-queen of Rhoynar legend, Nymeria was no common beast. She was of the direwolves—ancient guardians of the North, thought long vanished until the Stark children each found one in the snow.
Fierce and protective, she defended Arya even as a pup, biting Prince Joffrey to save her from his wrath. To protect her companion, Arya cast Nymeria into the wild, an exile that spared her from Cersei’s vengeance.
In the wilderness, Nymeria did not die. She grew, commanding a monstrous pack that haunted the Riverlands, known in whispers and fearful tales told by broken men. When she and Arya were at last reunited, the bond remained, though the paths of wolf and woman had diverged. A creature of the free wild, Nymeria chose not to return to chains or castles.",Not Available,"Ghost, Grey Wind, Lady, Shaggydog, Summer",None
CH293,Gilly,https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MrAnderson-Data/got-tableau-dashboard/main/images/characters/Gilly.png,Human,House Tarly,https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MrAnderson-Data/got-tableau-dashboard/main/images/house/House_Tarly.png,Alive,"Born among the cold and cruelty of Craster’s Keep, Gilly was one of many daughters born into a twisted and incestuous existence. She bore a child by Craster, and when the men of the Night’s Watch came north, she found a rare ally in the gentle heart of Samwell Tarly.
Together they fled the darkness of the far North, braving both wights and wildlings. Gilly saw the Wall, crossed it, and in time came to dwell among the learned men of Oldtown, where she began to shed her fear and ignorance.
Though she bore no sword and claimed no title, her survival was a quiet act of defiance. In her love for Sam and care for Little Sam, she helped preserve a fragment of hope and humanity as the world tumbled into war and winter.",Not Available,Not Available,Little Sam

He traveled briefly with Arya Stark, Gendry, and others, more concerned with food than war or lineage.
Where others saw death, he saw kitchens. Left behind at the Inn of the Crossroads, Hot Pie embraced the art of baking with a passion unmatched by blades or banners. His direwolf-shaped bread became legend among travelers, a symbol of stubborn joy amid ruin.
Though absent from the great battles and bloody reckonings, Hot Pie endured. In a land where survival itself became a rare magic, he found peace in dough and fire.",Not Available,Not Available,Not Available
CH295,Robin Arryn,https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MrAnderson-Data/got-tableau-dashboard/main/images/characters/Robin_Arryn.png,Human,House of Arryn,https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MrAnderson-Data/got-tableau-dashboard/main/images/house/House_Arryn.png,Alive,"Robin Arryn, Lord of the Eyrie, was raised amid the clouds—coddled, frail, and prone to fits. His mother, Lady Lysa, doted upon him to a suffocating degree, shaping him into a boy-king feared by no one and mocked by many.
After her sudden death and the arrival of Petyr Baelish, Robin became a pawn in a larger game. Left under the guidance of the Vale’s great houses and tutored by Baelish, he grew slowly into a more capable, if still strange, lord.
He reemerged during the final reckoning of Westeros, lending the Vale’s knights to the Stark cause. Though no warrior himself, Robin’s political weight as Warden of the East helped stabilize the realm in the wars' wake.","Lysa Tully, Jon Arryn",Not Available,Not Available

Brave, but not bold; loyal, but not cunning. As heir to Riverrun, he stood firm against the Lannisters during the War of the Five Kings, earning victories but also making grave miscalculations.
Most infamous was his role in the Red Wedding, where he was married to Roslin Frey as a trap to draw the Starks into Walder Frey’s ambush. He alone survived the massacre, kept as a hostage, a token of shame.
Freed in time, he was mocked in Dragonpit council for attempting to claim kingship, yet he endured. In the end, Edmure returned to Riverrun, a relic of the old Riverlands—wounded in pride, but unbroken in spirit.",Hoster Tully,"Catelyn Stark, Lysa Tully",Not Available
