CH002,Aemon Targaryen,Human,Night's Watch,King Maekar I Targaryen and Dyanna Dayne,King Aegon V Targaryen,None (took a vow of celibacy as a Maester),None,Dead,Not Available,Castle Black,Not Available,"Born Aemon of House Targaryen, he cast off crown and claim to don the black of the Night’s Watch. A scholar, a healer, and a dragon in exile, Maester Aemon served at Castle Black until his bones bent with age and his eyes faded to blindness.
He counseled kings and crows alike, his words laced with wisdom born of sorrow. In fire and blood, he saw prophecy—visions of his kin's fall, and of the prince that was promised.
When the cold wind howled beyond the Wall, he remained a beacon in the dark, whispering truths forgotten even by fire itself. He died far from home, a dragon who chose duty over power, and whose watch ended only in death.",,
CH003,Alliser Thorne,Human,House Thorne,Not Available,Not Available,Not Available,None,Dead,Not Available,Castle Black,Not Available,"Hard as the frost of the Wall and bitter as the wind atop it, Ser Alliser Thorne bled black long before he donned the cloak. Once a knight of King’s Landing, he was cast to the Wall for backing the losing side of Robert’s Rebellion.
He served as master-at-arms at Castle Black, where he forged young boys into hardened men with cruelty sharp as iron. His hatred for Jon Snow burned like a dying ember—dim but persistent.
When the Lord Commander broke oaths and welcomed wildlings, it was Thorne who called him traitor and led the blade. Yet the realm he claimed to protect crumbled under the very darkness Jon sought to stop. Thorne died by the rope—bitter, defiant, and unrepentant.",,

CH005,Amory Lorch,Human,House Lorch,Not Available,Not Available,Not Available,Not Available,Dead,Not Available,Harrenhal,Rhaenys Targaryen,"A brute clad in steel, Ser Amory Lorch served House Lannister as a sword, not a man. His reputation dripped with blood, from the sack of Elia Martell’s children to countless nameless dead strewn across the Riverlands.
He was neither knight nor monster—only a cruel instrument, loyal to coin and command.
At Harrenhal, he hunted prisoners and presided over the tortures that turned the blackened fortress into a place of dread. But in the end, he was undone not by battle, but by a shadow—Arya’s whispered vengeance, passed through the lips of death itself.",,
CH006,Areo Hotah,Human,Not Available,Not Available,Not Available,Not Available,Not Available,Dead,Not Available,Dorne,Arys Oakheart,"The stoic and formidable captain of Prince Doran Martell's guard in Dorne.

Ser Arthur Dayne of House Dayne was a legend clad in silver plate, the most honorable knight of his age and the deadliest by far.
At the Tower of Joy, he stood with only two others against six—and nearly won. He fell to young Ned Stark and the northern blades, though not without the weight of treachery at his back.
Even in death, tales of Dayne’s prowess echoed through courts and camps alike. He was the sword Westeros never again would wield—shining, gallant, and gone too soon.",,
CH008,Arya Stark,Human,House Stark,"Eddard Stark, Catelyn Stark","Robb, Sansa, Bran, Rickon",None (never married),None,Alive,"Needle, Valyrian steel dagger",King's Landing,"Meryn Trant, Walder Frey, Night King","Arya of House Stark, the wolf girl, the water dancer, the one who whispered names into the dark. Born to nobility, she cast aside silks and stitches for steel.
She wandered through war, through lands of dust and death, forging herself in the fires of loss. From the Hound to the House of Black and White, every step stripped her down and built her anew.
She became No One, but remembered who she was. Vengeance sang in her blood, and death bowed to her will.
When the Long Night came, it was Arya—child of Winterfell—who struck the blow that legends would never forget. But she did not stay to be remembered. She sailed west, toward the edge of maps and the unknown, where only wolves dare tread.",,

CH012,Baelish soldier,Human,House Baelish,Not Available,Not Available,Not Available,Not Available,Not Available,Not Available,King's Landing,Not Available,"He bore no name in the songs, no coat of arms upon his chest. He wore the mocking bird of Littlefinger, and that was cause enough for distrust.
In shadowed halls and behind stone walls, he served a master who smiled with knives. Whether in the Vale, the Fingers, or King’s Landing, these men moved like whispers—quiet, loyal, and paid.
When the schemes collapsed and the spider’s web burned, many such men vanished with their master’s ambition—forgotten, unmarked, but dangerous all the same.",,
CH013,Balon House Greyjoy,Human,House Greyjoy,Quellon Greyjoy,"Euron Greyjoy, Victarion Greyjoy",Alannys Harlaw,"Theon, Yara, Rodrik, Maron",Dead,Not Available,Pyke,Not Available,"Lord of the Iron Islands and father to Theon.

CH015,Baratheon of Dragonstone soldier,Human,House Baratheon,Not Available,Not Available,Not Available,Not Available,Not Available,Not Available,Stormlands,Not Available,"Clad in black and gold, these men marched beneath the stag and flame, loyal to the Lord of Dragonstone, Stannis Baratheon.
They followed him through ash and shadow, through Blackwater’s fire and the icy wastes of the North. Stern of face and sharp of sword, they were not men of laughter or song, but duty—unyielding, unrelenting.
Many burned for their king’s cause—some by blade, others by the fires of R’hllor. They were not remembered in glory, but in the smoke that clung to every step Stannis took toward doom.",,
CH016,Baratheon of King's Landing soldier,Human,House Baratheon,Not Available,Not Available,Not Available,Not Available,Not Available,Not Available,King's Landing,Not Available,"The red and gold cloaks of King’s Landing bore the crown stag of House Baratheon during Robert’s reign, though few held his spirit.
They swaggered in the shadow of power, half guards, half brutes. When Robert fell, they bent like reeds in the wind—first to Joffrey, then to fear, then to whoever wore the crown.
Their loyalty was not to a king, but to survival. And when the lion roared louder than the stag, they changed their tune to match the court’s cruel music.",,
CH017,Baratheon of Storm's End guard,Human,House Baratheon,Not Available,Not Available,Not Available,Not Available,Not Available,Not Available,Storm's End,Not Available,"A loyal soldier serving House Baratheon at Storm's End, standing firm during sieges and embodying the resilience of the Stormlands.",,

CH019,Barristan Selmy,Human,House Selmy,Ser Lyonel Selmy,Not Available,None,None,Dead,Sword,Meereen,Sons of the Harpy,"Barristan the Bold, the last true knight of Westeros, stood tall even as kingdoms crumbled.
A member of the Kingsguard from youth, he served Targaryens and Baratheons alike, his blade unsullied by politics or pride.
Dismissed by a boy king with no honor, he crossed the Narrow Sea and pledged himself once more to House Targaryen—not for ambition, but for justice.
In Meereen, he stood beside Daenerys, sword in hand, heart still noble. He died as he lived—not in bed, not in retreat, but with sword drawn, surrounded by foes, fighting for a queen who sought to break the wheel.",,
CH020,Belicho Paenymion,Human,House Paenymion,Not Available,Not Available,Not Available,Not Available,Dead,Not Available,Meereen,Not Available,"A member of Meereen's ruling elite, resistant to Daenerys's reforms. His opposition marks him as an obstacle to the city's transformation.",,

His eye lost, his flesh scarred, Beric became more ghost than man. He walked through darkness with a flaming sword and a hollowed soul.
He led the Brotherhood Without Banners, fighting not for lords or glory, but for the people crushed beneath the boots of war.
At the end, he gave his final life so others could live—his last resurrection a gift to the realm, paid with fire and faith.",,

CH025,Boar,Boar,Not Available,Not Available,Not Available,Not Available,Tusks,Dead,Not Available,The Kingswood,Not Available,"It was no mere beast that felled King Robert Baratheon. The great boar of the Kingswood was a tusked omen, a wrathful avatar of the old gods or perhaps the gods’ justice for a usurper grown fat and slow.
They said it gored the king through the belly, its rage unshaken by blade or crown. Some whispered that wine loosened Robert’s grip, others that poison made his veins run slow.
Whatever the truth, the boar did what armies and assassins could not—it ended the stag's reign with tusk and fury. Its carcass was feasted upon, but its legacy lingered in the blood that stained the Iron Throne.",,
CH026,Hound,Dog,House Bolton,Not Available,Not Available,Not Available,Teeth,Dead,Not Available,King's Landing,Not Available,Savage hunting dog.,,

They marched beneath the flayed man, practiced in torture, masters of fear. Whether roasting captives or skinning rebels, they did not just kill—they unmade.
When Roose Bolton rose, these men were his shadow. When Ramsay ruled, they became monsters in the shape of men.
But fear is a fickle master. When Winterfell burned and the wolves returned, these soldiers were hunted, one by one, their screams swallowed by the snows they once ruled.",,
CH029,Bowen Marsh,Human,Night's Watch,Not Available,Not Available,Not Available,Not Available,Dead,Not Available,Castle Black,Not Available,The cautious and traditional First Steward of the Night's Watch. His resistance to change leads to pivotal decisions affecting the Watch's future.,,
CH030,Brienne of Tarth,Human,House Tarth,Selwyn Tarth,Dead,None,None,Alive,Oathkeeper,Not Available,Sandor Clegane,"They called her the Maid of Tarth, but she was no fair maiden. Brienne was a tower of steel and loyalty, a true knight in all but name.
Mocked for her looks, scorned for her dreams, she chose honor over comfort, oaths over glory. She served Renly Baratheon, then Catelyn Stark, then Jaime Lannister—yet belonged to none.
Her blade was named Oathkeeper, and she wielded it in the name of promises others forgot. She crossed a kingdom for a girl she barely knew, fought a bear, defied lords, and lived not by pride but by principle.
In the end, she was knighted not by titles, but by truth. The songs may not sing of her beauty—but they will never forget her courage.",,
CH031,Bronn,Human,Not Available,Not Available,Not Available,Not Available,Not Available,Alive,Sword,Not Available,Ser Vardis Egen,"Bronn of the Blackwater, sellsword, climber of ladders and ladders of men. He entered the story with a sly grin and a quick blade, fighting for coin and drinking for joy.
He fought for Tyrion, not out of friendship but for gold—and yet stayed longer than coin required. He killed knights, dodged lords, bedded women, and kept his boots dry.
When the realm burned and dragons soared, Bronn rose higher still—from lowborn killer to Lord of Highgarden, with titles he barely respected.
He was the kind of man history forgets and legends envy—a survivor, a schemer, and a man too clever to ever die in someone else’s war.",,
CH032,Brother Ray,Human,Not Available,Not Available,Not Available,Not Available,Not Available,Dead,Not Available,Riverlands,Not Available,"A peaceful septon who renounces violence, leading a group of villagers in a tranquil life. His past and teachings leave a lasting impact on Sandor Clegane.",,

Daughter to Tywin, twin to Jaime, mother to kings, she believed herself a queen of destiny.
Her beauty was a weapon, her love a poison, her hatred boundless. She ruled through whispers and wildfire, making allies of enemies and corpses of rivals.
The prophecy of Maggy the Frog haunted her steps—gold would be her shroud, her children would die, and she would be cast down by a younger queen.
She became queen of ash and silence, a mother mourning sons she twisted, a queen with no people left to rule.
In the end, the Red Keep crumbled around her, and all her power amounted to nothing but stone and dust.",,

CH040,City watch guard,Human,Not Available,Not Available,Not Available,Not Available,Not Available,Not Available,Sword or spear,King's Landing,Not Available,"Gold cloaks they were called, but few bore the weight of justice. The City Watch of King’s Landing served not the law, but the throne—or whoever held it.
They were gaolers and gatekeepers, thugs in uniform, patrolling alleyways thick with rot and secrets.
When kings rose and fell, so did their loyalty. When chaos came, they looted before they fought. And when dragons flew overhead, many dropped their cloaks and fled, leaving justice to the flames.",,
CH041,Clegane's horse,Horse,House Clegane,Not Available,Not Available,Not Available,Not Available,Dead,Not Available,King's Landing,Not Available,"A monstrous black stallion befitting its fearsome rider, Sandor 'The Hound' Clegane. As fierce and stubborn as the man it carried.",,

He served the Second Sons until he slit his captains' throats and offered their heads to a queen. For Daenerys Targaryen, he became sword, lover, and ruthless advisor.
He spoke in blades and boldness, wooing with wit and winning with blood.
When Daenerys crossed the sea, she left him behind—to keep the peace in Meereen. Some say he ruled as a tyrant in velvet; others say he still waits for his silver queen to return.",,
CH044,Daenerys Targaryen,Human,House Targaryen,Aerys II Targaryen,Rhaegar Targaryen and Viserys Targaryen,None,"Drogon, Rhaegar, Viserion",Dead,Dragons,"Throne Room, King's Landing",Civilians,"Stormborn in exile, mother of dragons, breaker of chains. Daenerys Targaryen rose from ash and blood, the last embers of a dying dynasty.
She walked through fire and came forth reborn, forging an army not from lords, but from the broken and the bound.
Her mercy was fierce, her justice unforgiving. She freed cities, shattered chains, and scorched those who stood against her. But in her heart burned the fire of old Valyria—and fire consumes.
In the end, her dream of a better world became a nightmare wrought in dragonflame. Slain by the one she loved, she died at the edge of the throne she never sat upon—hailed as both liberator and tyrant.",,

Dickon was all things a knight should be—brave, loyal, gallant—but bound by duty to a father made of stone.
He fought for the Tyrells, then bent the knee to the crown. When Daenerys demanded fealty after battle, Dickon stood by his father, choosing honor over survival.
For that choice, he died in dragonfire—reduced to ash for the crime of loyalty.",,

Six pups found in the snow, born of a dead she-wolf and destined to mirror their Stark companions.
Each direwolf carried a shard of its master’s soul—fierce Ghost, loyal Grey Wind, savage Nymeria, gentle Lady, fearless Summer, and doomed Shaggydog.
They were guardians, avengers, omens. And as the Starks fell and rose, so too did their wolves—vanishing one by one into death, shadow, or legend.
Only a few remained when the dust settled—white-furred ghosts among men. Many Direwolf are unnamed in the known lore though their impact is none the less relevant.",,

Each man was a warrior from birth, his braid uncut until shamed in battle. They lived by the arakh and died in glory.

He served the Night’s Watch with grumbling loyalty, surviving battles that claimed braver men.
He stood with Jon Snow through mutiny and madness, fire and ice. And when Jon left the Wall, Edd bore the burden of command with grim reluctance.

Sent south with dreams of courtly romance, she became a political hostage of the Lannisters, a pawn in the war that would shatter the Seven Kingdoms. Under Queen Cersei’s withering eye and Joffrey’s sadistic cruelty, her innocence was burned away.
She bore the burden of silence, surviving with poise where others fell in fury. Her time in King’s Landing, the Vale, and Winterfell shaped her into a keen political mind, refined by Littlefinger’s manipulation and tempered by the horror of Ramsay Bolton’s cruelty.

In the wilderness, Nymeria did not die. She grew, commanding a monstrous pack that haunted the Riverlands, known in whispers and fearful tales told by broken men. When she and Arya were at last reunited, the bond remained, though the paths of wolf and woman had diverged. A creature of the free wild, Nymeria chose not to return to chains or castles.",,

Together they fled the darkness of the far North, braving both wights and wildlings. Gilly saw the Wall, crossed it, and in time came to dwell among the learned men of Oldtown, where she began to shed her fear and ignorance.

He traveled briefly with Arya Stark, Gendry, and others, more concerned with food than war or lineage.
Where others saw death, he saw kitchens. Left behind at the Inn of the Crossroads, Hot Pie embraced the art of baking with a passion unmatched by blades or banners. His direwolf-shaped bread became legend among travelers, a symbol of stubborn joy amid ruin.
Though absent from the great battles and bloody reckonings, Hot Pie endured. In a land where survival itself became a rare magic, he found peace in dough and fire.",,

His mother, Lady Lysa, doted upon him to a suffocating degree, shaping him into a boy-king feared by no one and mocked by many.
After her sudden death and the arrival of Petyr Baelish, Robin became a pawn in a larger game. Left under the guidance of the Vale’s great houses and tutored by Baelish, he grew slowly into a more capable, if still strange, lord.
He reemerged during the final reckoning of Westeros, lending the Vale’s knights to the Stark cause. Though no warrior himself, Robin’s political weight as Warden of the East helped stabilize the realm in the wars' wake.",,

Most infamous was his role in the Red Wedding, where he was married to Roslin Frey as a trap to draw the Starks into Walder Frey’s ambush. He alone survived the massacre, kept as a hostage, a token of shame.
Freed in time, he was mocked in Dragonpit council for attempting to claim kingship, yet he endured. In the end, Edmure returned to Riverrun, a relic of the old Riverlands—wounded in pride, but unbroken in spirit.",,

Once a wet nurse, she outlived generations of Starks and became the keeper of their hearth-side legends.
She spoke of the Long Night, of White Walkers and giants, of the Night King and children of the forest—not with fear, but with the heavy certainty of memory. To the young Stark children, she was both a source of comfort and a conduit for ancient dread.
When Winterfell fell to Theon and later to the Boltons, her fate was never confirmed. Yet her words endured, and as the Long Night crept once more across the North, many wondered if her tales were not stories at all—but prophecy, misremembered.",,

As a septa of the Most Devout, she served the High Sparrow in the Faith Militant’s rise to power during the final days of House Baratheon’s reign.

When Queen Cersei Lannister fell into the Faith’s grip, it was Unella who became her keeper and tormentor. With a bell in one hand and righteousness in the other, she marched Cersei naked through the streets of King’s Landing, chanting “Shame” with cold, ritualistic precision. She became a living symbol of the Faith’s harsh justice, her impassive gaze a blade sharper than steel.

But the wheel turns swiftly in Westeros. When Cersei returned to power through wildfire and wrath, it was Unella who found herself chained. Left to the mercy of the Queen and the monstrous Ser Gregor Clegane, her screams echoed deep in the Red Keep’s dungeons—then faded into silence.

Her final fate was never revealed, though some whisper she died a slow death beneath the castle, while others say she still lingers, broken and forgotten. Either way, her legacy lives on—in bell chimes and nightmares.",,
