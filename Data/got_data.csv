LOC001,Asshai,,5729,298.8,Enigmatic eastern port of dark magic.
LOC002,Asshai-by-the-Shadow,,5789,398.4,Home of shadowbinders like Melisandre.
LOC003,Astapor,,3389,1334.8,"Nestled along the Slaver’s Bay, Astapor is a city of red bricks and darker history. Its famed harbors once echoed with the cries of the chained—slaves bred for obedience and perfected into the Unsullied, an army unlike any other. Built in the shadow of Ghiscari traditions, Astapor stood proud yet rotted from within, its rulers—known as the Good Masters—glutted on cruelty and wealth. When Daenerys Stormborn arrived, dragon at her side and fire in her heart, the city was cast into chaos. The chains were shattered, the masters burned, and the Unsullied marched free. Yet liberty bore a steep price, and Astapor soon spiraled into anarchy, consumed by the very rage it once subdued.
"
LOC004,Battle of the Bastards field,,1161,3123.5,Battleground for a great battle.
LOC005,Beyond the Wall,,1191,3628.9,"A land of endless frost and ancient dread, Beyond the Wall is the last known wilderness of Westeros. Here, snowdrifts swallow the sky, and great white forests hold whispers of a forgotten age. Giants roam the icy valleys, mammoths thunder across the tundra, and the Free Folk—called Wildlings by those in the South—make homes from bone, stone, and fire. Yet colder terrors linger. In the deep dark, the White Walkers stir—creatures of ice and night, born before the histories of men. The Wall was built to guard against such nightmares, but even it could not stand forever. When the Night King rose, the dead marched, and the chill that came was older than death itself."
LOC006,Blackwater Bay,,1424,2102.5,Naval battles and key approach to the capital.
LOC007,Braavos,,1909,2653.4,"Braavos, the Secret City, stands proud amid the fog of the Shivering Sea, hidden by mountains and tides. It was born of rebellion—a haven for slaves who fled the Valyrian Freehold and vowed never to bow again. A city of canals and stone bridges, Braavos pulses with mystery and power. The Titan, a giant statue of cold iron, stands sentinel at its harbor, roaring a warning to any ship that dares enter. Within the city lie the famed Iron Bank, whose debts are honored more than kings, and the House of Black and White, where Faceless Men grant death as a gift. No banners fly above Braavos, for it serves no throne but its own."
LOC008,Casterly Rock,,717.1,2192,"Rising above the Sunset Sea, Casterly Rock is a fortress carved into a cliff of gold. It is the ancestral seat of House Lannister, whose wealth flows as deep as the veins of ore beneath their walls. Legend speaks of Lann the Clever, who tricked the Casterlys from their seat and claimed the Rock without bloodshed. Since then, the Lannisters have ruled with coin and cunning, commanding Westeros with both blade and banknote. The Rock itself is impenetrable, with twisting tunnels, treasure-filled halls, and towers built into the stone. During the War of the Five Kings, its gold propped up kingdoms, but even gold rusts when spilled on battlefields.
"
LOC009,Castle Black,,1286.8,3589,"Perched at the edge of the known world, Castle Black is the grim stronghold of the Night’s Watch. Built in the shadow of the Wall, it is a bastion of black stone and snow, a place where honor meets exile. Thieves, bastards, and broken men come here to find redemption or ruin. Its great elevator climbs the Wall’s dizzying height, offering a view of the cold horizon and the endless fear beyond. Here, Jon Snow rose to Lord Commander, and here, he died—then rose again. Castle Black saw the first spark of unity between the Watch and the Free Folk, as well as the first hammer of the dead’s return."
LOC010,Dorne,,1090,1526.3,"South of the Red Mountains, where the sun blazes and sands burn, lies Dorne—land of heat, passion, and pride. Ruled from Sunspear by House Martell, Dorne is unlike any other realm in Westeros. Its customs are fierce and free; its women rule and ride alongside men; its warriors wield curved spears and tempers both. Once conquered by dragons, Dorne resisted with fire of its own and was the last to bend the knee. Its history is steeped in blood and beauty—Elia Martell’s murder ignited the fire in Oberyn’s vengeance, and the Sand Snakes carry their father’s fury still. Dorne does not forget, and it never forgives."
LOC011,Dragonstone,,1545,2228.9,"Jagged and foreboding, Dragonstone juts from the Narrow Sea like a talon of black rock. Forged by Valyrians before their Doom, it is carved from obsidian and ancient magic. This was the first seat of House Targaryen in Westeros, a place of dragons and dark fire. Its stone hallways are etched with draconic reliefs, and its chamber hearths roar like wyrms. Stannis Baratheon claimed it during Robert’s Rebellion, lighting the fires of Melisandre’s shadowy faith. When Daenerys returned from exile, it was to Dragonstone she came, to reclaim the realm with fire and blood. The castle still whispers with the breath of sleeping dragons."
LOC012,Dreadfort,,1367.9,3236,"The Dreadfort is a place of pale stone and darker deeds, the ancestral home of House Bolton. Nestled in the chill of the North, its towers are high and its walls cruel. Long before the Starks united the North, the Boltons flayed their enemies alive, wearing their skins as cloaks. The banners were lowered in peace, but the knives never dulled. When Roose Bolton betrayed Robb Stark at the Red Wedding, he claimed the title Warden of the North—but it was his bastard, Ramsay, who truly ruled. The Dreadfort became a house of horrors, where hounds fed on men and screams echoed through frozen halls."
LOC013,Eastern Road,,1273.4,2405,"The Eastern Road winds from the Vale through mountain passes and perilous forests, linking the secluded Eyrie with the greater kingdoms. It is a path of travelers and traders, but also one of blood and broken wheels. Bandits and sellswords often stalk its bends, and the shadows of the Mountains of the Moon have swallowed more men than the Eyrie has sheltered. It was along this road that Tyrion Lannister first met Bronn, and where bonds of blood and gold were forged. Though not a place of stone and banners, the Eastern Road is as vital a part of Westeros’s weave as any keep or castle."
LOC014,Field of Fire,,974,2102.5,Legendary Targaryen conquest battle site.
LOC015,Gods Eye & Isle of Faces,,1201,2269.3,"Ancient and mysterious, tied to the Children of the Forest."
LOC016,Hardhome,,1424,3730,"Once a thriving Free Folk settlement, Hardhome now lies as a haunted memory on the desolate coast Beyond the Wall. Legends speak of its sudden and horrific fall. Fire and screams echoed across the sea as an ancient doom, now known to be the White Walkers and their undead legions, descended upon it. Thousands vanished overnight, and the few who fled brought only terror and tales of blue-eyed corpses. When Jon Snow sailed there to rescue the Wildlings, he witnessed the nightmare firsthand. Hardhome stands today as a ruin claimed by ice, a grim monument to the rising tide of death."
LOC017,Harrenhal,,1217.3,2309,"Harrenhal was once the grandest castle ever built in Westeros, a colossus of stone rising from the shores of the Gods Eye. Lord Harren Hoare dared build it to defy the world, but his pride was scorched from the skies. Aegon the Conqueror and his dragon Balerion turned the towers to ash on the very day of its completion, melting stone and flesh alike. Since then, Harrenhal has been cursed, passing from lord to doomed lord. Its halls echo with ruin, and the brave speak of ghosts in its charred bones. No house holds it long, for death walks freely within its blackened walls."
LOC018,Highgarden,,870.7,1790,"Highgarden is the jewel of the Reach, a sun-drenched citadel of roses and gold. Seat of House Tyrell, it lies along the Mander River, its blooming terraces and marble towers surrounded by orchards and vineyards. Known for its bounty, chivalry, and courtly splendor, Highgarden has long been a seat of culture and power. It was here that Lady Olenna, the Queen of Thorns, wielded her words like daggers, shaping alliances and fates. Though the Tyrells fell to Lannister fire and betrayal, the garden still blooms, its roots deep and its memory sweet with summer."
LOC019,Hollow Hill,,1282,2309.7,"Hidden in the riverlands' dense forests, Hollow Hill was the secret redoubt of the Brotherhood Without Banners. Beneath ancient oaks and through forgotten tunnels, the outlaws gathered not to plunder but to protect. There, Lord Beric Dondarrion was reborn again and again by the Lord of Light, his patchwork followers bound by a cause of justice in a lawless land. The hill is more than a hideout; it is a symbol of resistance, of broken oaths made whole again beneath the earth. In the war-torn realm, Hollow Hill became legend."
LOC020,Iron Islands,,696,2517,"Rising from the tempestuous Ironman's Bay, the Iron Islands are a scattered archipelago of jagged stone and storm-wracked cliffs. The people here are seafarers, raiders, and worshippers of the Drowned God. ""What is dead may never die,"" they say, for the Ironborn live hard and die harder. Pyke, the twisted seat of House Greyjoy, perches like a broken crown atop sea-carved rocks. The Old Way, long abandoned by the mainland, thrives here—steel over coin, salt over softness. Though often dismissed by the great houses, the Ironborn strike swift and vanish like mist, their oars beating war into the waves."
LOC021,King's Landing,,1302.9,2091,"The heart of the Seven Kingdoms, King’s Landing is a city of splendor and squalor, golden domes shadowed by reeking alleys. Built where Aegon the Conqueror first set foot on Westeros, it rose into the capital through fire and conquest. The Red Keep looms over the city like a crimson sentinel, its halls echoing with secrets, steel, and schemes. It was here kings rose and fell, where wildfire consumed a tyrant's reign, and where the Iron Throne sat as both prize and curse. A city of a million souls and a thousand knives, King’s Landing bleeds history."
LOC022,Kingsroad,,1292,2188.4,"The Kingsroad is the great spine of Westeros, stretching from Castle Black to the capital. It binds the realm, a ribbon of cobbled stone and worn earth winding through forests, fields, and fates. On this road rode kings and killers, knights and bastards, queens cloaked in mystery and rebels cloaked in blood. It was along this path that Eddard Stark journeyed south to his doom, and along which Arya Stark vanished into legend. The Kingsroad is no mere path—it is the story of a kingdom, told in footsteps."
LOC023,Last Hearth,,1311.7,3435,"Far in the North, just shy of the Wall, lies Last Hearth, the ancestral seat of House Umber. Its grey halls were built to withstand the snows and the savagery of winter, and its men are mountain-hearted and fierce. The Umbers were known for their loyalty to House Stark, though the winds of war bent even the proud. When the dead marched, Last Hearth fell quickly, its keep stained with frost and death. There, a child pinned to a wall, surrounded by limbs in a spiral, marked the White Walkers’ terrible message: winter had truly come."
LOC024,Lhazar,,3870,1561.7,"A land of peace among the blood-soaked lands of Slaver's Bay, Lhazar is a humble realm of shepherds and prayer. Its people, the Lhazareen, tend flocks and offer worship to the Great Shepherd, eschewing war and conquest. But peace is fragile. Khal Drogo’s khalasar razed their villages, taking what they wished and leaving ash. It was among these gentle people that Daenerys Targaryen's mercy was kindled and her dragons fed for the first time. Lhazar bleeds quietly, a pastoral song muffled by war drums."
LOC025,Lys,,1939,1455.5,Free City of Essos.
LOC026,Meereen,,3521,1612.2,"The greatest of the Slaver’s Bay cities, Meereen rises with pyramids and cruelty. Its streets are lined with the bones of slaves crucified as warnings, its masters robed in tradition and tyranny. When Daenerys conquered it, she brought change as sharp as any sword. She abolished chains and brought dragons into the sky, but also sowed discord among the powerful and the poor. The Sons of the Harpy rose in secret revolt, cloaked in gold and blood. Meereen became a crucible of rule and rebellion, its walls echoing with the cries of freedom and fire."
LOC027,Moat Cailin,,1116.1,2866,"Moat Cailin is a fortress of moss-covered ruins and murder, perched on the Neck like a gate of ancient teeth. Built by the First Men to defend the North, its crumbling towers remain nearly impassable. Any army seeking to march from the South must pass through its narrow causeways, where a handful can fell legions. Held by ironborn, taken by trickery, and reclaimed by the Starks, Moat Cailin is not merely a fortification—it is a line drawn in blood, a last breath before the North."
LOC028,Mole's Town,,1242,3507.6,"Nestled in the shadow of Castle Black, Mole’s Town is a crooked hamlet of brothels, ale, and whispers. Its tunnels dig beneath the frost, hiding secrets and sinners alike. Though small and squalid, it served as both release and refuge for brothers of the Watch and Wildlings alike. When the Night’s Watch fell into turmoil, and the dead rose beyond the Wall, Mole’s Town was swept away like kindling, its fire doused in icy shadow."
LOC029,Myr,,2045,1784.1,Free City of Essos.
LOC030,Norvos,,2258,2304.7,Free City of Essos.
LOC031,Oxcross,,796.5,2249,"Oxcross lies in the Westerlands, a fertile plain turned graveyard. During the War of the Five Kings, Robb Stark outmaneuvered the Lannister host by taking this unguarded path, striking swift and hard under cover of forest. It was here that the Young Wolf's legend grew, where steel flashed in the night and Tywin Lannister's confidence was shaken. Though a simple patch of land, Oxcross became a symbol—of strategy, surprise, and the brittle nature of power."
LOC032,Pentos,,1926.1,2113,"A wealthy Free City on the western coast of Essos, Pentos is a land of opulence and intrigue. Its red-bricked palaces overlook the Summer Sea, while merchant princes rule through wealth and cunning rather than steel. Though bound by trade pacts and uneasy alliances, the city's prosperity is shadowed by the sacrifices demanded by its customs—once, the lives of maidens to appease their gods. It was here that Daenerys Targaryen began her fateful journey, sold into marriage by her brother Viserys, setting in motion a saga that would shake the world."
LOC033,Qarth,,4441,1127,"""The greatest city that ever was or will be,"" Qarth lies at the edge of the Red Waste, a jewel of culture and magic surrounded by desert death. Its triple walls—each more ornate than the last—protect a society of traders, mystics, and deceivers. The ruling Pureborn dwell in splendor, while the enigmatic warlocks of the House of the Undying whisper secrets through blue lips. It was here that Daenerys sought allies and was betrayed, nearly succumbing to dark visions in the depths of the House of the Undying."
LOC034,Red Waste,,4239,1501,"A scorched, barren expanse of sun-baked earth and parching winds, the Red Waste tests the will of any who dare cross it. Few survive its cruel sands without a guide, and none escape unchanged. Following the death of Khal Drogo, Daenerys led her khalasar through this wasteland, enduring starvation, thirst, and despair until salvation arrived in the form of Qarth’s glimmering gates."
LOC035,Riverlands,,1110,2491.7,"The heart of Westeros, the Riverlands are a realm of rolling hills, fertile rivers, and deep-seated vengeance. Controlled by House Tully of Riverrun, the region has borne the brunt of countless wars, from Aegon’s Conquest to the War of the Five Kings. It is a land where loyalty is tested, and betrayal often blooms beside banners. The Red Wedding, one of the realm’s most infamous massacres, took place within these war-torn lands."
LOC036,Riverrun,,1016.8,2375,"Seat of House Tully, Riverrun sits at the confluence of the Red Fork and Tumblestone rivers. A fortress of red stone and cascading water, it has long stood as a bastion of honor and family. During the War of the Five Kings, it served as a key stronghold for Robb Stark and his bannermen. Later besieged by Lannister forces, the castle’s fate swayed with the tides of war, but its legacy as a symbol of the Riverlands’ proud resistance endures."
LOC037,Robb Stark's camp,,1034,2410.8,"A mobile command post during the War of the Five Kings, Robb Stark’s camp moved with the Young Wolf’s army through the Riverlands and Westerlands. Tents of direwolf banners and makeshift strategy halls bore witness to bold decisions and ill-fated romances. It was within these campfires that Robb forged his legend—and ultimately, sealed his doom through love and defiance of oath."
LOC038,Roseroad,,1006.7,1931,"The main highway between King’s Landing and Highgarden, the Roseroad winds through fertile lands and lush meadows, its very name evoking the beauty of the Reach. It serves as a vital artery for trade and military movement. During the wars that wracked the realm, it bore the tramp of marching armies and the ashes of burned villages, yet in peacetime, it remains a corridor of wealth and splendor."
LOC039,Skagos,,1560,3568.3,Cannibal-rumored island off the North.
LOC040,Storm's End,,1500.1,1878,"A fortress forged in defiance of nature itself, Storm’s End rises above the narrow peninsula facing Shipbreaker Bay. Its walls are a marvel of engineering and magic, said to have been raised by the legendary Bran the Builder. Home to House Baratheon, it has withstood centuries of sieges and storms alike. During the War of the Five Kings, it became a stage for ambition and sacrifice as Stannis Baratheon claimed it as his base of power, his path darkened by sorcery and shadow."
LOC041,Tarth,,1600.1,1904,"Island of Brienne’s origin, aka ""Sapphire Isle""."
LOC042,The Citadel,,716,1602.1,"The Citadel is the headquarters of the maesters, who serve as scholars, healers, and advisors."
LOC043,The Crownlands,,1353,2193.5,The region around King’s Landing.
LOC044,The Eyrie,,1381.2,2494,"Perched atop the Giant’s Lance in the Vale of Arryn, the Eyrie is a castle in the clouds, accessible only by a treacherous mountain path. Known for its impregnable position and the Moon Door—a drop to death for condemned prisoners—the Eyrie reflects the aloofness and pride of House Arryn. Here, Lysa Arryn ruled with fear and madness, and the trials of Tyrion Lannister began his fateful journey."
LOC045,The Fist of the First Men,,1029,3714.9,"a legendary and strategic location north of the Wall, often referenced in the Night’s Watch’s expeditions."
LOC046,The Gift,,1267,3517.7,"A swath of fertile land south of the Wall, the Gift was bestowed upon the Night’s Watch by House Stark in ages past. Once tilled by free folk in service of the Watch, it has long lain fallow, as the Watch’s numbers dwindled and the wildlings encroached. The land remains a somber reminder of honor unheeded and duty long forgotten."
LOC047,The Haunted Forest,,1176,3770.5,Beyond the Wall area of major mystical significance.
LOC048,The Narrow Sea,,1712,2249.1,"A restless expanse that separates Westeros from Essos, the Narrow Sea is more than a mere stretch of water—it is a crucible of cultures, trade, and conquest. Its ports bustle with ships bearing silks, spices, and secrets. Daenerys Targaryen’s dragons would soar over it on their journey to reclaim a throne, and countless lords, pirates, and exiles have found fortune or death upon its waves."
LOC049,The Reach,,1009,2041.9,"Fertile, populous region of House Tyrell."
LOC050,The Shadow Lands,,6023,662,"East of Asshai, ultra-lore-heavy, dragon and magic origin speculation."
LOC051,The Shadow Sea,,6311,581.1,"Mysterious and uncharted, east of Essos."

LOC053,The Trident,,1196,2395.7,Site of Robert Baratheon’s rebellion-winning battle.
LOC054,The Twins,,1065,2587.7,"Straddling the Green Fork of the Trident, the Twins are the ancestral seat of House Frey, a house known more for ambition than honor. The two identical towers, connected by a stone bridge, form a vital crossing and a strategic stronghold. Though mocked for their upjumped lineage, the Freys gained infamy during the Red Wedding, a massacre that altered the course of the War of the Five Kings. The Twins now stand not only as a physical crossing but as a symbol of treachery cloaked in hospitality."
LOC055,The Vale,,1489,2517,"Encircled by the towering peaks of the Mountains of the Moon, the Vale of Arryn is a realm of isolation and serenity, ruled from the sky-piercing castle of the Eyrie. Known for its chivalric traditions and pure-blooded nobility, the Vale has remained aloof from many of the realm’s conflicts. Yet, beneath its pristine snows and steep trails lies a land of political maneuvering and deadly ambition. The Knights of the Vale are among the finest horsemen in Westeros, and their late entry into the wars of the realm often turns tides."
LOC056,The Wall,,1331.3,3604,"A colossal monument of ice and magic, the Wall stands as the last defense between the realms of men and the wild terrors of the far north. Raised eight thousand years ago by Brandon the Builder, it stretches 700 feet high and 300 miles long. Manned by the Night’s Watch, a sworn brotherhood of exiles and warriors, the Wall has seen generations of uneasy peace, until the return of the White Walkers turned its legend into reality. From Castle Black to Eastwatch-by-the-Sea, the Wall is a frozen sentinel over forgotten nightmares."
LOC057,Torrhen’s Square,,941.7,3087,Taken by Theon in the show.
LOC058,Tower of Joy,,928,1566.7,Legendary location of Jon Snow’s birth.
LOC059,Tyrosh,,1782,1728.5,"Renowned for its dyed beards, opulent textiles, and political intrigue, Tyrosh is a city of silk and subterfuge. It is ruled by archons and merchant princes, its wealth born from controlling the sea-lanes of the Narrow Sea. Wars among the Free Cities have stained its streets many times, yet Tyrosh endures—gaudy, decadent, and deadly. The city’s loyalty is always for sale, but its pride is priceless."
LOC060,Not Available,,3000,1500,"The lands deemed ""Not Available"" are the shadowed edges of maps and the whispers in campfire tales. They represent the forgotten, the unexplored, and the erased. Be they distant shores, cursed ruins, or lands lost to time, these regions are as vast in rumor as they are in mystery. Some say dragons still sleep there. Others speak of entire civilizations turned to ash. In a world of shifting alliances and ancient power, ""Not Available"" is not absence—but potential."
LOC061,Vaes Dothrak,,4135.6,2266,"Nestled beneath the Mother of Mountains, Vaes Dothrak is the only city of the Dothraki, the fierce horse-lords of the Great Grass Sea. No walls surround it, for the Dothraki fear no invaders. Statues of the gods of conquered peoples line its entrance, a silent testament to the khalasars' victories. The city serves as sacred ground, where blood must not be spilled and the Dosh Khaleen—wise widows of fallen khals—hold prophecy and power. Here, fire burns, old customs bind, and destinies are shaped in shadow and flame."
LOC062,Valyria,,2817.4,970,"Once the heart of a vast empire, Valyria is now a haunted ruin swallowed by cataclysm. Its smoking seas and twisted remnants are all that remain of the Doom, a disaster that shattered the greatest civilization ever known. Home to dragonlords and sorcery, Valyria crafted blades of legend and built cities that touched the sky. Now, only whispers remain—of demons, fire-wracked ruins, and the few families, like House Targaryen, who escaped its fall. Valyria is a graveyard of gods, a cradle of nightmares, and a warning to those who would play with power unchecked."
LOC063,Volantis,,2500.6,1450,One of the Free Cities; lore-rich.
LOC064,Winterfell,,1106.8,3187,"Set in the heart of the cold North, Winterfell is the ancient stronghold of House Stark. Built by Brandon the Builder after the Long Night, its halls echo with the creeds of honor, family, and resilience. Beneath it lie crypts stretching into darkness, where the kings of winter sleep with swords in stone. Winterfell has burned and bled, changed hands and stood firm. It is not merely a castle but a symbol—a beacon in the snow that winter may come, but the North remembers."
LOC065,Yunkai,,3431.7,1544,"Yunkai, the Yellow City, sits upon the southern coast of Slaver’s Bay, wrapped in the golden sands of ancient decadence. Smaller than Meereen and less martial than Astapor, Yunkai thrives on trade and subjugation. Its walls are strong, but its spirit is sluggish, dulled by the luxury of masters and the suffering of slaves. When Daenerys Targaryen came with fire and liberation, the city's foundations trembled. Though freed, Yunkai’s chains were not so easily cast aside, and its future remains a battleground between old ways and reborn ideals."
